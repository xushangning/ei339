# Cliffwalk

Run the script `cliffwalk.py` with the Python Interpreter. It will produce a
file `q_values_and_policy.pdf` in the current directory that visualize the
Q-values and the optimal policy.

**Note: the script may not terminate due to the problem outlined in the
report!**

Tested with Python 3.7.4 and Matplotlib 3.1.1.
